Adds two-factor authentication for user and administrators via LogonBox Authenticator.

== Description ==
[See our video on how LogonBox Authenticator works.](https://www.logonbox.com/content/logonbox-authenticator/)

LogonBox Authenticator provides simple to use two-factor authentication for your users, armed with only a mobile app.

In order to use this plugin, you will require access to one of our on-prem or cloud products to act as a server for 
the authentication. All users that you wish to protect with 2FA must also exist on this product with identical email addresses.  

== Installation ==

See [our instructions](https://docs.logonbox.com/app/manpage/en/article/7737790).
