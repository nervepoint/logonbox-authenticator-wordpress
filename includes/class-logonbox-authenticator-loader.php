 *
 * Actions vs. Filters #Actions vs. Filters
 *
 * The main difference between an action and a filter can be summed up like this:
 *
 * - an action takes the info it receives, does something with it, and returns nothing.
 *     In other words: it acts on something and then exits, returning nothing back to the calling hook.
 *
 * - a filter takes the info it receives, modifies it somehow, and returns it.
 *     In other words: it filters something and passes it back to the hook for further use.
 *
 * Said another way:
 *
 * - an action interrupts the code flow to do something, and then returns back to the normal flow without modifying anything;
 * - a filter is used to modify something in a specific way so that the modification is then used by code later on.
 *
 * The something referred to is the parameter list sent via the hook definition. More on this in later sections.
